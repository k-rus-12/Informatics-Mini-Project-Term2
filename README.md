The case: Psychologist.
Many students are counselled by the psychologists regarding the needed skillsets for their chosen University degrees. 
Much of this information is repeated by the psychologist and it is a time-consuming process. 
Often students make multiple visits if they change their choice of degree. The psychologist would like to make this process more efficient. 
You have been selected to apply technology to solve this issue.

The issue: It takes too long to explain to each and every student the skillsets required for their chosen degree.
